## Usage & Controls

### Toggle Discord Integration

Discord Rich Presence is **enabled by default** but can be controlled through the application:

**Enable/Disable**: 
- Go to `Options` ‚Üí `Discord: Enabled/Disabled` in the menu bar
- The menu shows the current status (Enabled/Disabled)
- Changes take effect immediately
- Your preference is saved and remembered between app restarts

**Automatic Behavior**:
- When enabled: Discord integration automatically starts when you launch GamesList Manager (if Discord is running)
- When disabled: No Discord connections are made and your Discord status remains unchanged
- The integration gracefully handles Discord being unavailable

**Manual Control**:
- You can also disable by closing Discord entirely
- Or disable activity status in Discord settings

## Customization

### Updating Status Messages

You can customize the status messages by editing the `discord_integration.py` file:

- `update_presence_browsing()` - When browsing different tabs
- `update_presence_playing()` - When tracking game time
- `update_presence_browsing()` - When in different tabs
- `update_presence_editing_game()` - When editing games
- etc.

### Adding Custom Buttons

The status includes a "View on GitHub" button by default. You can:

1. Change the URL to your own project
2. Add additional buttons (Discord supports up to 2)
3. Remove buttons entirely

**Important**: Buttons have specific requirements:
- Only appear on Discord **desktop app** (not mobile/web)
- Your Discord application may need proper configuration
- Some Discord applications require verification for buttons to work
- Buttons use format: `[{"label": "Button Text", "url": "https://example.com"}]`

## Troubleshooting

### "Discord Rich Presence not available" Message

This means the `pypresence` library isn't installed:
```bash
pip install pypresence
```

### Status Not Showing

1. **Discord not running**: Make sure Discord is open
2. **Wrong Application ID**: Double-check you copied the right ID
3. **Firewall issues**: Make sure Discord can connect (usually not an issue)
4. **Discord activity status**: Check that "Display current activity as a status message" is enabled in Discord Settings ‚Üí Activity Privacy

### Status Shows but No Images

1. Make sure you uploaded assets to your Discord application
2. Check that the asset names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. It can take a few minutes for new assets to be available

## Privacy Note

Discord Rich Presence only shares:
- What you're currently doing (playing X game, browsing library, etc.)
- How long you've been doing it
- Your total game count and completion stats
- No personal game data, ratings, or notes are shared

You can disable Rich Presence at any time by:
1. **Using the menu toggle**: `Options` ‚Üí `Discord: Enabled/Disabled` (recommended)
2. Closing GamesList Manager
3. Disabling activity status in Discord settings  
4. Closing Discord entirely

## Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check that Discord is running and you're logged in
2. Verify your Application ID is correct
3. Make sure `pypresence` is installed
4. Check the console output for error messages
