- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Memory**: 512MB RAM minimum
- **Storage**: 50MB available space

**Note**: This application has been primarily developed and tested on Windows. macOS and Linux compatibility has not been thoroughly tested and may require additional configuration or adjustments.

## Installation

### üì¶ **Quick Installation (Recommended)**

For most users, the easiest way to get started is to download the pre-built application:

1. **Download**: Go to the [Releases section](https://github.com/DrNefarius/GameTracker/releases/) of this GitHub repository
2. **Extract**: Download the latest release zip file and extract it to a folder of your choice
3. **Run**: Launch the application by running the included `GameTracker.exe` file (Windows)

**That's it!** No additional setup, Python installation, or dependency management required.

### üîß **Advanced Installation (Build from Source)**

If you prefer to build from source or are using macOS/Linux, see the [Build From Source](#build-from-source) section below for detailed instructions.

## Build From Source

### Important Note: PySimpleGUI Availability
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Information**: The required PySimpleGUI version (4.60.5) is **no longer officially available** from the original developers. PySimpleGUI moved to a licensed model for versions 5+ and removed all free older versions from official distribution channels.

**You will need to use a community fork to run this application:**
- **Recommended Source**: [https://github.com/markreading/PySimpleGUI_4_60_5](https://github.com/markreading/PySimpleGUI_4_60_5)
- This repository contains PySimpleGUI version 4.60.5, which was used in the development of this application
- Version 4.60.5 was one of the last free versions before the licensing changes

### 1. Clone or Download the Project
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd GamesList
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install PySimpleGUI from Community Fork
Since PySimpleGUI 4.60.5 is no longer officially available, you have two options:

#### Option A: Manual Installation (Recommended)
1. Download or clone the PySimpleGUI fork: [https://github.com/markreading/PySimpleGUI_4_60_5](https://github.com/markreading/PySimpleGUI_4_60_5)
2. Copy the `PySimpleGUI` folder to your project directory, or
3. Install it to your Python site-packages directory:
   - **Windows**: `AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python3XX/Lib/site-packages`
   - **macOS/Linux**: Check your Python installation's site-packages location

#### Option B: Install Other Dependencies First
```bash
# Install all other dependencies except PySimpleGUI
pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0 openpyxl>=3.0.0 Pillow>=9.0.0
```
Then follow Option A for PySimpleGUI installation.

### 4. Install Remaining Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: This may fail for PySimpleGUI if using the standard requirements.txt. Follow the PySimpleGUI community fork installation above.*

### Required Dependencies:
- **PySimpleGUI** (4.60.0+, <5.0.0) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Must use community fork** - GUI framework
- **matplotlib** (3.5.0+) - Data visualization  
- **openpyxl** (3.0.0+) - Excel file support
- **Pillow** (9.0.0+) - Image processing for emoji rendering

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
python main.py
```
